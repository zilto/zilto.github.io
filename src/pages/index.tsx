            I'm Thierry &nbsp;üëã I'm a machine learning engineer, data scientist, and open source developer. I maintain the libraries <a href="https://github.com/dagworks-inc/hamilton" target="_">Hamilton</a> for lightweight data orchestration and <a href="https://github.com/dagworks-inc/burr" target="_">Burr</a> for LLM agents.
          </p>
          <p>
            A few things I did:
            <li>Consultant to implement dynamic bidding for an ad exchange</li>
            <li>Build the ML platform for my graduate research lab</li>
            <li>Taught advanced topics around LLMs, ML-powered search, and causal inference to learners from Amazon, Snapchat, PayPal, Instacart, Tinder, etc.</li>
            <li>Manage client-facing Power BI products at a SaaS company</li>
            <li>Conduct psychometric research with managers and C-level executives in the insurance and banking sectors</li>
            <li>Give paid public-speaking workshops to university students</li>
            <li>Contributed code, issues, or blog posts to open source projects: dlt, Ibis, Instructor, OpenVINO, LanceDB, PyTorch Lightning, and more. </li>
          </p>
          <p>
            My ability to learn and my empathy allow me to quickly grasp new domains, understand users needs, and build meaningful connections. Hence, I particularly love working in startup environments where shipping features that provide value to users is a priority.

            If there's an activity you've been interested in and putting away, I encourage you to stop reading this and go focus on that instead! You'll be amazed by the progress you've made in a week, a month, and a year from now. Practice makes perfect and more is more.
